# Workshop on Automated Vehicle Safety: Verification, Validation and Transparency

Automated Vehicles (AV) are maturing rapidly but safety is still an open problem and we must address the challenge of AV safety together as an industry. With recent traffic incidents involving AVs under test, we believe that is important to address the safety challenges inherent in the technology and help the innovation to move forward. This workshop invites researchers, industry professionals, government officials to discuss, challenge and develop a holistic AV Safety methodology and related practices. We will host presentations around the state-of-the-art work contributing to verification, validation, testing and transparency of AV safety. Such presentations will be complemented with industry and government insights into the challenges and applicability methods to AV safety.
